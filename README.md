## Development Setup

Create a `.env` file with the private key of the account to deploy the smart contracts to Wallaby
```
PRIVATE_KEY = <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

PLEASE NOTE - By Default, all contracts will be deployed on FEVM, as we use a lot of [Zondax's APIs](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-solidity) available exclusively on FVM
